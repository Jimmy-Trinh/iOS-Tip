# Pre-work - *Tip!*

**Tip!** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Jimmy Trinh**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations (added shake animation if tapping anywhere not editable)
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Starting bill amount page, which goes to total after input. Can go back and forth after.
- [x] Clean up UI with graphics, font, and color changes.
- [ ] Settings page. Allows user to select default tip.
- [ ] Dark mode option.

-Being very confused about user defaults and how to use them across multiple screens.
